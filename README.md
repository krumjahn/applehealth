## ‚ö° Quick Start

Local (recommended for interactive charts)

```bash
# 1) Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/krumjahn/applehealth.git
cd applehealth

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Run the app (you'll be prompted for export.xml; outputs go to ./health_out)
python src/applehealth.py

# Optional: Advanced flags if you already know the paths
# python src/applehealth.py --export "/absolute/path/to/export.xml" --out "./health_out"
```

Docker (saves charts/CSVs to your host folder)

```bash
# 1) Build the image
docker build -t applehealth .

# 2) Run the container (quote paths with spaces)
docker run -it \
  -v "/absolute/path/to/export.xml":/export.xml \
  -v "$(pwd)":/out \
  applehealth
```

Windows (PowerShell) example

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/krumjahn/applehealth.git
cd applehealth
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/applehealth.py --export "C:\Users\you\Downloads\export.xml" --out ".\health_out"

# Docker
docker build -t applehealth .
docker run -it `
  -v "C:\Users\you\Downloads\export.xml:/export.xml" `
  -v "${PWD}:/out" `
  applehealth
```

### Makefile shortcuts (macOS/Linux)

For convenience, you can use the included Makefile:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
make docker-build

# Run via Docker (set EXPORT to your export.xml, OUT is where files will be written)
make docker-run EXPORT="/absolute/path/to/export.xml" OUT="$(pwd)"

# Run locally with interactive charts
make run-local EXPORT="/absolute/path/to/export.xml" OUT="./health_out"

# Start a shell in the container (for debugging)
make docker-run-bash EXPORT="/absolute/path/to/export.xml" OUT="$(pwd)"
```

Note: On Windows, Makefile targets require a Make tool (e.g., Git Bash + make or WSL). Otherwise use the plain docker/python commands above.

## Example A.I. analysis

[Read more here](https://rumjahn.com/how-i-used-a-i-to-analyze-8-years-of-apple-health-fitness-data-to-uncover-actionable-insights/)

Here are the most surprising insights from your health data:

```
Marathon-Level Days: You've had several "super active" days exceeding 40,000 steps, with your record being 46,996 steps on March 24, 2018 - equivalent to walking about 23 miles! Interestingly, these extremely active days often don't coincide with recorded workouts.

Reversed Weekend Pattern: Unlike most people who are more active on weekends, your data shows consistently lower step counts on weekends, suggesting your physical activity is more tied to workdays than leisure time.

Workout Evolution: Your exercise patterns have notably changed over the years - you've shifted from frequent, shorter workouts to less frequent but more intense sessions. Recent workouts show higher average heart rates despite being less frequent.

Seasonal Anomalies: While there's a general trend of higher activity in spring/summer, some of your most active periods occurred during winter months, particularly in December and January of recent years.

Heart Rate Cycles: Your data shows interesting 3-4 week cycles where resting heart rate gradually increases then drops, possibly indicating training load and recovery patterns.

COVID Impact: There's a clear signature of the pandemic in your data, with more erratic step patterns and changed workout routines during 2020-2021, followed by a distinct recovery pattern in late 2021.

Morning Consistency: Your most successful workout periods consistently occur in morning hours, with these sessions showing better heart rate performance compared to other times.
```

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- openai, anthropic, google-generativeai
- python-dotenv
- xml.etree.ElementTree (included in Python standard library)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krumjahn/applehealth.git
   cd applehealth
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up OpenAI API key and optional Ollama configuration (optional, only needed for AI analysis):
   - Get your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project directory
   - Add your OpenAI API key and optional configuration:

     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     OLLAMA_HOST=http://your-ollama-server:11434
     ```

   Note: If OLLAMA_HOST is not set, it will default to http://localhost:11434

4. **Set up Ollama for local AI analysis**:
   - Install Ollama: <https://ollama.ai/download>
   - Start Ollama service (keep running in background):

     ```bash
     ollama serve
     ```

   - Download Deepseek-R1 model:

     ```bash
     ollama pull deepseek-r1
     ```

## üì± Getting Your Health Data

1. On your iPhone:
   - Open the Health app
   - Tap your profile picture
   - Select "Export All Health Data"
   - Save and extract the zip file
   - Locate `export.xml`

2. Place `export.xml` in the same directory as the script

## üíª Usage

You can run the tool locally (recommended for interactive charts) or via Docker (saves charts as PNGs).

Local (interactive charts):

```bash
# From the repository root (simplest):
python src/applehealth.py

# or change into src/ then run
cd src
python applehealth.py

# Optional: if you already know the paths, you can specify them
# python src/applehealth.py --export "/path/to/export.xml" --out "./health_out"
```

Notes:
- If you omit `--export`, the app will prompt you for the path (you can drag-and-drop the file or folder).
- By default, outputs are saved to `./health_out`.
- `--out` lets you choose a different output folder.

## üê≥ Docker Usage

Docker runs in a headless environment: charts do not pop up, but are saved as PNGs. Outputs are written to `/out` inside the container by default.

1) Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t applehealth .
```

2) Run the container, mounting your `export.xml` and an output directory from your host:

```bash
# macOS/Linux (paths with spaces must be quoted)
docker run -it \
  -v "/absolute/path/to/export.xml":/export.xml \
  -v "$(pwd)":/out \
  applehealth
```

Examples:
- If your export is in Downloads with a space in the name:
  `-v "/Users/you/Downloads/apple_health_export 2/export.xml":/export.xml`
- Write outputs to a custom folder on host:
  `-v "/Users/you/Desktop/health_out":/out`

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
docker run -it `
  -v "C:\Users\you\Downloads\export.xml:/export.xml" `
  -v "${PWD}:/out" `
  applehealth
```

Notes:
- No need for `--network host` in typical use. The app only needs outbound internet if you use AI features (ChatGPT/remote Ollama). The default Docker networking is fine.
- Inside Docker, the app auto-detects `/export.xml` and saves outputs to `/out`.
- You can still pass flags if you prefer: `--export /export.xml --out /out`.

### ü§ñ AI Analysis

The new AI analysis feature (Option 7) will:

- Analyze all your exported health data
- Provide personalized insights using ChatGPT
- Identify patterns and trends
- Suggest potential improvements
- Highlight unusual findings

Notes:
- If you haven‚Äôt run any analysis yet, the AI options will trigger the necessary data exports automatically.
- API keys can be provided via `.env` or pasted when prompted in the terminal:
  - ChatGPT (OpenAI): `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - Claude (Anthropic): `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - Gemini (Google): `GEMINI_API_KEY`
  - Grok (xAI): `GROK_API_KEY`
  - OpenRouter: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
  If not present, the app will ask you to paste your key at runtime.

### üñ•Ô∏è Local LLM Analysis

The local analysis feature (Option 8) will:

- Process data entirely on your machine
- Use Ollama with Deepseek-R1 by default
- Provide technical analysis of health patterns
- No data leaves your computer

### üåê External LLM Analysis

The external LLM analysis feature (Option 9) will:

- Connect to a remote Ollama instance
- Default to a preconfigured remote server
- Allow customization of the server URL
- Automatically detect available models
- Fall back to local Ollama if remote connection fails

**To use different models**:

1. For local analysis, edit `applehealth.py` and find the `analyze_with_ollama()` function
2. Change the model name in this line:

   ```python
   model='deepseek-r1'  # Change to 'llama2', 'mistral', etc.
   ```

3. Pull your desired model first:

   ```bash
   ollama pull <model-name>
   ```
   
4. For external analysis, when prompted, enter the URL of your remote Ollama server

## üì¶ Outputs

The tool writes the following per-metric outputs in the chosen output directory:
- CSVs: `steps_data.csv`, `distance_data.csv`, `heart_rate_data.csv`, `weight_data.csv`, `sleep_data.csv`, `workout_data.csv`
- Plots: `steps_plot.png`, `distance_plot.png`, `heart_rate_plot.png`, `weight_plot.png`, `sleep_plot.png`, `workout_plot.png`
- AI analyses (optional): timestamped `.md` files summarizing insights

On macOS/Linux, the app prints a one-line tip to open each saved plot (e.g., `open "./steps_plot.png"`).

AI model preferences
- The tool remembers your last-selected models for each AI provider (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok, OpenRouter).
- Preferences are stored in `~/.applehealth/ai_prefs.json` by default (override with `APPLEHEALTH_PREFS`).
- The app also remembers your last-used export.xml path and output directory in the same `ai_prefs.json`.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

- "export.xml not found" error:
  - Use `--export "/absolute/path/to/export.xml"` or provide the directory containing it.
  - In Docker, mount the file: `-v "/absolute/path/to/export.xml":/export.xml`.
  - Paths with spaces must be quoted. On Windows, use double backslashes or quotes.
  - The app will prompt for the path if not provided; look for "Using export file: ...".

- No charts appear in Docker:
  - Expected. Docker runs headless; charts are saved as PNGs in `/out`.
  - Open the saved file on your host (the app prints `open "...png"`).
  - To see interactive charts, run locally (outside Docker).

- No CSV/PNG files found:
  - Make sure you ran one of the analysis options (1‚Äì6). AI options will generate them if needed.
  - Check the configured output directory (default: current dir locally, `/out` in Docker).
  - Use `--out "/path/to/output"` to control where files are written.

- OpenAI API key errors:
  - Create `.env` with `OPENAI_API_KEY=...` in your working directory.
  - In Docker, pass envs via `--env-file .env` or `-e OPENAI_API_KEY=...`.
  - Network access is required for ChatGPT; verify your connection.

- Ollama errors (local or external):
  - Local: install Ollama, run `ollama serve`, and `ollama pull deepseek-r1`.
  - External: set `OLLAMA_HOST=http://host:11434` or enter the URL when prompted.
  - If external fails, the tool can fall back to local Ollama.

- Paths with spaces or Windows paths:
  - Quote paths: `"/Users/you/Downloads/apple_health_export 2/export.xml"`.
  - Windows examples are shown for Docker (PowerShell). Use quotes for `--export` and `--out` as well.

- "Is a directory" error for export.xml:
  - This happens when Docker mounts a directory to a path expected to be a file.
  - Use the provided commands that bind the file to `/export.xml`, or pass `--export` pointing to a valid file.

- Step CSV filename confusion:
  - The tool exports both `steps_data.csv` and a compatibility `stepsdata.csv`.

- Useful env vars:
  - `EXPORT_XML` (path to export.xml), `OUTPUT_DIR` (output folder), `OLLAMA_HOST`.
