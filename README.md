Here are the most surprising insights from your health data:

```
Marathon-Level Days: You've had several "super active" days exceeding 40,000 steps, with your record being 46,996 steps on March 24, 2018 - equivalent to walking about 23 miles! Interestingly, these extremely active days often don't coincide with recorded workouts.

Reversed Weekend Pattern: Unlike most people who are more active on weekends, your data shows consistently lower step counts on weekends, suggesting your physical activity is more tied to workdays than leisure time.

Workout Evolution: Your exercise patterns have notably changed over the years - you've shifted from frequent, shorter workouts to less frequent but more intense sessions. Recent workouts show higher average heart rates despite being less frequent.

Seasonal Anomalies: While there's a general trend of higher activity in spring/summer, some of your most active periods occurred during winter months, particularly in December and January of recent years.

Heart Rate Cycles: Your data shows interesting 3-4 week cycles where resting heart rate gradually increases then drops, possibly indicating training load and recovery patterns.

COVID Impact: There's a clear signature of the pandemic in your data, with more erratic step patterns and changed workout routines during 2020-2021, followed by a distinct recovery pattern in late 2021.

Morning Consistency: Your most successful workout periods consistently occur in morning hours, with these sessions showing better heart rate performance compared to other times.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/krumjahn/applehealth.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up OpenAI API key and optional Ollama configuration:
   - Get your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project directory
   - Add your OpenAI API key and optional configuration:

     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
     OLLAMA_HOST=http://your-ollama-server:11434
     ```

   Note: If OLLAMA_HOST is not set, it will default to http://localhost:11434

4. **Set up Ollama for local AI analysis**:
   - Install Ollama: <https://ollama.ai/download>
   - Start Ollama service (keep running in background):

     ```bash
     ollama serve
     ```

   - Download Deepseek-R1 model:

     ```bash
     ollama pull deepseek-r1
     ```

## üì± Getting Your Health Data

1. On your iPhone:
   - Open the Health app
   - Tap your profile picture
   - Select "Export All Health Data"
   - Save and extract the zip file
   - Locate `export.xml`

2. Place `export.xml` in the same directory as the script

## üíª Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python applehealth.py
```

## üê≥ Docker Usage

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t applehealth .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run --network="host" -v $(pwd)/export.xml:/app/export.xml -it applehealth
   ```

Choose from the menu:

1. Steps Analysis

### ü§ñ AI Analysis

The new AI analysis feature (Option 7) will:

- Analyze all your exported health data
- Provide personalized insights using ChatGPT
- Identify patterns and trends
- Suggest potential improvements
- Highlight unusual findings

Note: You must run at least one other analysis option first to generate the data files for AI analysis.

### üñ•Ô∏è Local LLM Analysis

The local analysis feature (Option 8) will:

- Process data entirely on your machine
- Use Ollama with Deepseek-R1 by default
- Provide technical analysis of health patterns
- No data leaves your computer

### üåê External LLM Analysis

The external LLM analysis feature (Option 9) will:

- Connect to a remote Ollama instance
- Default to a preconfigured remote server
- Allow customization of the server URL
- Automatically detect available models
- Fall back to local Ollama if remote connection fails

**To use different models**:

1. For local analysis, edit `applehealth.py` and find the `analyze_with_ollama()` function
2. Change the model name in this line:

   ```python
   model='deepseek-r1'  # Change to 'llama2', 'mistral', etc.
   ```

3. Pull your desired model first:

   ```bash
   ollama pull <model-name>
   ```
   
4. For external analysis, when prompted, enter the URL of your remote Ollama server
